#	Suppose you have Rs.100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's  100×1.1=110 rupees, and after two years it's 100×1.1×1.1=121.Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years, and print the result. 
a = 100
b = 100 * (1.1 ** 7)
print("The money we end up after 7 years is",b )
